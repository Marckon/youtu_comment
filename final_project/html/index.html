    <h1>friends of ED website back online</h1>
    <p>
        The problem I reported yesterday with the friendsofed.com domain appears to have been resolved, and the main website is now back online. To get the source code for my books, go to the friends of ED downloads page, and select the link for the relevant book. The books are listed alphabetically using the full title, so for example The Essential Guide to Dreamweaver CS4 is listed under T, not under E. You can also get the source code from my site, as indicated in yesterday’s post.

        If you’re contemplating buying one of my books, and want a better idea of what they’re like, sample chapters in PDF format are available for each title. Just go to the list of web design books at friends of ED, and click the link for the title you’re interested in. This brings up a description of the book; you can download the sample chapter from the links on the right.
